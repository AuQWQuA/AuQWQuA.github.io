I am a third-year PhD student at the [Programming Language Lab](http://pl.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), under the supervision of Prof. [Yingfei Xiong](https://xiongyingfei.github.io/).

My research focuses on **program synthesis**, **code generation**, and **large language models for software engineering**. I am particularly interested in developing better code representations and improving the reliability of LLM-based code generation systems.

Research Interests
======
- Program Synthesis and Algorithm Synthesis
- Code Representation and Grammar-based Approaches
- Large Language Models for Code Generation
- Code Understanding and Semantic Analysis
