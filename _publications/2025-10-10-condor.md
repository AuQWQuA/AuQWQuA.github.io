LLMs demonstrate significant potential across various software engineering tasks. However, they still face challenges in generating correct code on the first attempt when addressing complex requirements. Introducing a discriminator to select reliable outputs from multiple generated results is an effective way to enhance their reliability and stability. Currently, these discriminators fall into two categories: execution-based discriminators and non-execution-based discriminators. 

Execution-based discriminators face flexibility challenges due to difficulties in obtaining test cases and security concerns, while non-execution-based discriminators, although more flexible, struggle to capture subtle differences in code details. To maintain flexibility while improving the model's ability to capture fine-grained code details, this paper proposes Condor. We first design contrastive learning to optimize the code representations of the model.
